# Predicting the fate of the Tasmanian devil with a spatial epidemiological model

Spatially explicit, individual-based framework to model the spread of DFTD in Tasmania, implemented in Matlab.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have `Matlab` installed on your computer to run the collection of scripts. A single simulation runs on `Octave`, but `Sampler.m` needs to be changed to accommodate for a difference in the random number generator command.
